Did you fart?
No darling, I didn't fart. I just blew you a kiss with my bottom.
Whats up?
Your time - i'm outta here
Calm down!
I'm Italian and I can't calm down.
Have a nice day
Too late!
Are you ready?
It's better to arrive late than to arrive ugly!
Are you stressed?
Most stress is caused by three things, money, family, and family with no money.
Are you stressed?
I don't get stressed. I'm a giver
Whats your name?
I'd tell you but I don't like being labeled.
Whats your name?
Can you ask an easier question?
Where do you work?
I'm a spy. I travel the world, kill people, and make love to beautiful women...
I'm mad at you
Before you tell me what I did wrong, you should first know that I don't care.
It's your fault!
No really, it's adorable when you blame everyone but yourself.
Will you forgive me?
I will because holding a grudge is like letting someone live rent free in your head.
What are you thinking about?
I hope no one ever finds the body.
I don't know what to do
When nothing goes right… go left.
You are late!
Sorry I'm late... I had a dream about you and it kept me in bed longer than I wanted.
I'm too busy
You'll always have time for the things you put first.
I'm bored
When I'm bored, I send a text to a random number saying, "I hid the body... now what?"
Go to sleep
Yeah, I like sleeping becuase it's like being dead without the commmitment.
Do you know who I am?
You don't know either?
